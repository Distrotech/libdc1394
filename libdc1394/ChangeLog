Mon Jan 17 10:53:15 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Made constants in dc1394_control.c explicitly ULL, UL, or U

Mon Jan 17 14:04:46 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Put underscore in front of #ifdef in dc1394_control.h for convention
	* Added extern "C" to dc1394_control.h for C++ support

Wed Jan 19 18:30:49 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Converted values in dc1394_control.c to compensate for conversion
	  from little endian to big endian when transferred over 1394 bus.

Thu Jan 20 16:04:24 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Implemented conditional code for big endian/little endian machines
	  and changed autoconfig script to test for endianness.  Added file
	  src/config.h.in to define WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

Wed Jan 26 20:03:28 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed bug with #ifdef being using instead of #if for testing if
	  !WORDS_BIGENDIAN

Tue Feb  1 16:09:24 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added tons of new functionality for querying and setting features
	  on the camera.

Tue Feb  1 18:19:52 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Removed test pattern code since that is not part of the
	  1394-based Digital Camera spec.  It's specific to my TI camera.

Wed Feb  2 14:11:14 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed a bunch of bugs regarding the return value of raw1394_read()
	  (ie. it's >= 0 on no error, < 0 on error)

Fri Feb  4 11:03:42 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added more convenience functions and new functions to set auto mode,
	  turn features on/off, use one push auto mode, and read min/max values
	  for features
	* Fixed bug in reading the min value of a feature
	* Fixed major bug in version 0.2 with setting the value of a feature
	  (caused all other feature attributes to be cleared in the process)

Mon Mar 13 15:41:17 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Incorporated changes suggested by Per Dalgas Jakobsen.  This
	  effectively removes all the endian dependent code (much cleaner).

Mon Mar 13 18:28:49 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Incorporated more changes suggested by Per Dalgas Jakobsen to
	  further clean up the code.  Structured the rest of the code to
	  be uniform with these changes.
	* Changed the names of dc1394_get_current_value() and
	  dc1394_set_current_value() to dc1394_get_feature_value() and
	  dc1394_set_feature_value() (breaking compatibility with old library)
	* Added target_temperature parameter to dc1394_get_temperature()
	  (again breaking compatibility with old library)

Mon Oct 16 2000 <curmson@ri.cmu.edu>
	* Changed return values of external functions so that they return
	DC1394_SUCCESS or DC1394_FAILURE instead of returning the subsystem
	retval (allowing checks such as if (dc1394_call()<0) {error handle}
	(breaks compatability with old library)
	* Added routines to nicely handle setting up multiple cameras to 
	capture frames simultaneously
	* Added routines and structures that represent the entire feature set 
	of a camera, and can interrogate a camera to get the feature set in a
	somewhat optimized way
	* Added routines that return cameras nodes described by their unique ID
	* Fixed dc1394_get_camera_info 
	* functions added are:
	dc1394_get_camera_feature_set
	dc1394_get_caemra_feature
	dc1394_print_feature
	dc1394_print_feature_set
	dc1394_create_handle
	dc1394_get_camera_nodes
	dc1394_get_sorted_camera_nodes
	dc1394_print_camera_info
	dc1394_setup_camera
	dc1394_release_camera
	dc1394_multi_capture
	* structures added are:
	dc1394_cameracapture 
	dc1394_feature_info
	dc1394_feature_set

Thu Feb  1 02:39:22 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Updated to use new version of libraw1394
	* Changed error handling to use new libraw1394 error handling
	* Code beautification

Tue Feb  6 03:19:07 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added libraw1394 version detection to configuration process
	* Added compile options for different versions of libraw1394
	* Cleaned things up a bit

Wed Apr 11 14:24:19 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added patch from Dan Dennedy which included:
	   - resume iso receive in camera setup
	   - new dc1394_dma_unlisten() function in dc1394_capture.c
	   - mutually exclusive format enumerations
	* Made all enumerations mutually exclusive by 32 rather that 16
	* Fixed code which broke due to enumeration change
	* Added macros for feature to offset querying in dc1394_control.c
	* Added backwards compatibility to Format 7 register access code

Thu Apr 12 12:52:30 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed dc1394_get/set_video_mode/format/framerate to work with new
	  enumerations.
	* Fixed FEATURE_TO_VALUE/INQUIRY_OFFSET macros to work for both
	  FEATURE_HI and FEATURE_LO queries.
	* Exposed dc1394_feature_desc (feature description array).
	* Created dc1394_internal.h for definitions internal to the library
	* Moved some definitions from dc1394_control.h to dc1394_internal.h

Mon Apr 16 11:56:17 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed feature counting for loops in dc1394_control.c (Dan Dennedy)
	* Fixed get/set_trigger_mode functions in dc1394_control.c to work with
	  new enumerations (Damien Douxchamps)
	* Fixed color coding ID functions in dc1394_format7.c to conform to new
	  enumerations (Damien Douxchamps)

Tue Apr 24 15:12:19 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed problem with dc1394_auto_on_off() ignoring the value passed in
	  when setting auto mode on or off (fix by Li Ming
	  <ming@mpi-sb.mpg.de>)

Mon Apr 30 12:46:22 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed problem with dc1394_get_camera_feature() failing due to feature
	  id being modified by feature to offset macros (fix by Li Ming)

Thu Jun  7 12:29:26 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Applied Dan Dennedy's patch which fixes image capture with newest
	  version of libraw1394 (0.9) and fixes a small spelling mistake

Tue Jul  3 16:33:50 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added functions to control the trigger feature:
	     -dc1394_set_trigger_on_off()
	     -dc1394_get_trigger_on_off()
	  (addition by Audun Jan Myrhol <audun.myrhol@q-free.com>)

Sat Sept 08 02:19:48 2001 <dan@dennedy.org>

    * Updated kernel-video1394.h against current CVS version
    
Mon Sept 24 22:36:12 2001 <dan@dennedy.org>
	* moved src -> libdc1394
	* included examples subdir in autoconf and automake
	* added examples/Makefile.am
	* examples build, but do not automatically install 

---- v0.8.3 released -------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 23 15:48:00 2001 <douxchamps@ieee.org>
	* use dc1394 feature-indexed function in
	  dc1394_(get/set)_trigger_on_off
	  
Thu Jan 31 23:38:28 2002 <dan@dennedy.org>
    * dc1394_control.h: added dma_device_member to struct 
      dc1394_cameracapture. This enables support for mutliple
      host adapters as well as the new video1394 devfs names.
    * dc1394_capture.c: _dc1394_dma_basic_setup() uses 
      above struct member to open video1394 device. If the
      char pointer is null, then it defaults to "/dev/video1394"
      for backwards compatibility.
    * kernel-video1394.h: synchronize with video1394.h changes made
      Oct 21 and included in kernel 2.4.17!!

Fri Mar 15 14:43:31 2002 <douxchamps@ieee.org> 
	* dc1394_control.h: updated format7 functions
	* dc1394_format7.c: updated dc1394_query_format7_color_coding_id
	  so that it now returns a valid COLOR_FORMAT7_X value.

Mon Mar 18 14:43:31 2002 <douxchamps@ieee.org> 
	* dc1394_control.c: fixed bug in dc1394_set_feature_on_off: it
	would only set 'on' if the feature was 'off', no matter what
	was the argument.
	* dc1394_control.c: fixed quadlet-per-packet for format_0, mode_4,
	15fps (was 280, should have been 480)

Mon March 26 0:41:50 2002 <dan@dennedy.org>
    * Applied David Moore's <david@startbox.com> patch to avoid getting
      old captures with dma_multi_capture.
    * Applied John Stanley's <stanley@peak.org> patch to use multiple
      cameras on mutliple ports (hosts).
      NOTE: the new dc1394_destroy_handle() in dc1394_control.h
      NOTE: the dma device file defaults to the video1394 devfs default
      naming convention when not specified: /dev/video1394/<port>

Fri May 10 16:12:00 2002 <dan@dennedy.org>
    * dc1394_capture.c, dc1394_control.h:
      bugfixes in dc1394_cameracapture, dc1394_dma_multi_capture(),
      and _dc1394_dma_basic_setup() to better support grabbing all
      frames.
    * dc1394_capture.c: dc1394_dma_setup_capture() modified to take
      dma_device_file as a param to force users to set it.
      
Sun July 21 22:51:00 2002 <dan@dennedy.org>
    * added examples/dc1394_multiview.c to test/demonstrate multicapture
      over multiple ports.
	  
Fri July 28 00:26:00 2002 <dan@dennedy.org>
    * dc1394_capture.c: added drop_frames boolean to
      dc1394_dma_setup_capture().
    * bumped versions to 0.9 since interface has changed some.
      Correct libtool versions:
	    major=9, interface changed
		revision=0, first implementation of this interface
	    age=0 for no backwards compatibilty
    * examples/dc1394_multicapture: added drop_frames support, cleanup.

Wed Aug  7 17:08:31 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * added several format7 functions for IIDC 1.30 compatibility.
    * first quick hack of IIDC 1.30 handshaking for byte-per-packet
      setting in format7. This happens in _dc1394_basic_format7_setup.

Tue Aug 20 10:40:12 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * added support for Point Grey cameras, which support IIDC with
      a little tweak (modifications in dc1394_is_camera).

Thu Aug 22 10:10:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * Updated support for PointGrey cameras (added the 0x800002
      software revision code)
	
Thu Sep 03 10:45:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * Bugfix in v1.30 format7 capture handshake. Thanks to Yasutoshi Onishi
      for pointing it out.

Thu Sep 09 12:00:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * more v1.30 handshake update

Fri Sep 10 11 12:00:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * even more v1.30 handshake update (now with proper error handling)

Sun Sep 22 17:30:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * added absolute feature setting functions. This is a first hack. 

Mon Sep 23 10:10:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * debugged absolute settings. Tested for shutter without problems.

Fri Sep 27 13:00:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * more v1.30 handshake update to handle backward compatibility
      with v1.20

Tue Oct 22 15:10:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * applied Christophe Achard patch, with some modifications.

Thu Oct 22 15:10:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * added "dc1394bool_t abs_control" to "dc1394_feature_info" struct
    * fixed, cleaned-up and finalized the absolute control code

Fri Oct 23 17:19:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed missing <<16 shift in dc394_get_format7_unit_position

Sun Oct 27 00:13:00 2002 <dan@dennedy.org>
    * added examples/dc1394_vloopback.c to demonstrate how to make
      digital camera format0 a Video4Linux source.

Mon Nov 18 10:15:23 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * we now use packet_per_frame correctly for format7. This should
      fix 'walking' frames in DMA mode.
	
Mon Nov 20 10:35:00 2002 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * Use a little trick from Martin Gramatke to avoid misinterpreta-
      tion of TOTAL_BYTES registers. We don't use the latter register
      anymore.
	
Wed Jul 2 14:35:00 2003 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed some F7 issues. Thanks to Kero van Gelder.
    * changed total_bytes to unsigned long long int in
      dc1394_query_format7_total_bytes.

Wed Jul 30 09:32:01 CEST 2003 <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed bytes_per_packet setting in _dc1394_basic_format7_setup
    * cancelled the previous commit (18/7/2003): it was a mistake.

2003-08-12  Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>
   * dc1394_control.c: make config ROM reading more generic,
     remove tab indenting to make consistent
   * configure.in: incrmement lib revision

2003-08-13 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
	* dc1394_control.c: cleanup config ROM code; fix for Point
	        Grey cameras

2003-08-20  Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>
    * use command register base from config rom offset instead of hardcoded
    * make raw1394 userdata point to a new dc1394_camerahandle struct 
      containing port, software version, and command register base


2003-08-28 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed feature detection: we now use both 0x404 and 0x5XX registers in
      dc1394_is_feature_present. dc1394_query_feature_control is deprecated
      and has been commented out. 

2003-09-02  Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>
    * examples/*.c: call dc1394_destroy_handle() to cleanup mem and show
      proper technique
    * examples/dc1394_multiview.c: show new proper technique of multi-capture by
      creating a handle for each camera as opposed to port.
    * examples/gray_color_image.c: new example similar to grab_gray_image, but
      also contains example code how to locate first camera on any port and 
      attempt to make the camera non-root.

2003-09-15 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed format7 capture setting when the current size register is initialized
      to zero at the camera boot.
	  
2003-09-02  Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>
    * examples/grab_color_image.c: remove auto settings, add --guid option, add
      filename argument.
    * examples/dc1394_vloopback.c: add scaling, set default mode to mmap, add 
      mmap double buffering, add pipe mode option, adjust palette by option
      (pipe) or by ioctl, lookup default v4l device name via procfs, daemon
      option.

2003-09-23  Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>
   * examples/grab_color_image.c: fix locating cam by guid on any port
   * examples/dc1394_vloopback.c: add --guid option like grab_color_image
     and renamed some options, and added root detection and reset
	
2003-11-15 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixes/additions by Johann Schoonees:
    * fixed format7 capture setup function missing some parameters 
    * fixed compil warning in dc1394_absolute.c, line 261.
    * fixed harmless but misleading bug in dc1394_format7.c: line 802 should be removed.
    * add functions dc1394_get_one_shot and dc1394_get_multi_shot.
    * changed dc1394_get_camera_misc_info to avoid probing memory psec registers
      if no user memory is available. This is necessary for the iSight camera from Apple,
      which does not implement registers 0x618h thru 0x62Ch.
	
2003-12-04 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * little tag commit for version 0.9.2
	
2003-12-15 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed significant bug regarding IIDC specs revision detection
      (in dc1394_get_sw_revision).
	
2003-12-17 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * temporary fix for bpp settings in dc1394_format7_basic_setup
	
2003-12-24 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * updated the IOCTLs for kernels 2.4.21+ and 2.6.0+. This breaks compatibility with
      previous kernel versions.

2004-01-04 Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>
    * simplify video1394 includes and correct Damien's ChangLog entry about kernel 2.4
      compatibility.
    * examples/dc1394_vloopback.c: minor bugfixes.
    * autogen.sh: add missing libtoolize.
	
2004-01-14 Damien <ddouxchamps@users.sf.net>
    * fixed a bug related to IIDC version in format7 functions. All registers specific 
      of v1.30 are now only probed if the version is 1.30.
