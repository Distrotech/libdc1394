	* Made constants in dc1394_control.c explicitly ULL, UL, or U

Mon Jan 17 14:04:46 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Put underscore in front of #ifdef in dc1394_control.h for convention
	* Added extern "C" to dc1394_control.h for C++ support

Wed Jan 19 18:30:49 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Converted values in dc1394_control.c to compensate for conversion
	  from little endian to big endian when transferred over 1394 bus.

Thu Jan 20 16:04:24 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Implemented conditional code for big endian/little endian machines
	  and changed autoconfig script to test for endianness.  Added file
	  src/config.h.in to define WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

Wed Jan 26 20:03:28 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed bug with #ifdef being using instead of #if for testing if
	  !WORDS_BIGENDIAN

Tue Feb  1 16:09:24 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added tons of new functionality for querying and setting features
	  on the camera.

Tue Feb  1 18:19:52 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Removed test pattern code since that is not part of the
	  1394-based Digital Camera spec.  It's specific to my TI camera.

Wed Feb  2 14:11:14 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed a bunch of bugs regarding the return value of raw1394_read()
	  (ie. it's >= 0 on no error, < 0 on error)

Fri Feb  4 11:03:42 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added more convenience functions and new functions to set auto mode,
	  turn features on/off, use one push auto mode, and read min/max values
	  for features
	* Fixed bug in reading the min value of a feature
	* Fixed major bug in version 0.2 with setting the value of a feature
	  (caused all other feature attributes to be cleared in the process)

Mon Mar 13 15:41:17 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Incorporated changes suggested by Per Dalgas Jakobsen.  This
	  effectively removes all the endian dependent code (much cleaner).

Mon Mar 13 18:28:49 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Incorporated more changes suggested by Per Dalgas Jakobsen to
	  further clean up the code.  Structured the rest of the code to
	  be uniform with these changes.
	* Changed the names of dc1394_get_current_value() and
	  dc1394_set_current_value() to dc1394_get_feature_value() and
	  dc1394_set_feature_value() (breaking compatibility with old library)
	* Added target_temperature parameter to dc1394_get_temperature()
	  (again breaking compatibility with old library)

Mon Oct 16 2000 <curmson@ri.cmu.edu>
	* Changed return values of external functions so that they return
	DC1394_SUCCESS or DC1394_FAILURE instead of returning the subsystem
	retval (allowing checks such as if (dc1394_call()<0) {error handle}
	(breaks compatability with old library)
	* Added routines to nicely handle setting up multiple cameras to 
	capture frames simultaneously
	* Added routines and structures that represent the entire feature set 
	of a camera, and can interrogate a camera to get the feature set in a
	somewhat optimized way
	* Added routines that return cameras nodes described by their unique ID
	* Fixed dc1394_get_camera_info 
	* functions added are:
	dc1394_get_camera_feature_set
	dc1394_get_caemra_feature
	dc1394_print_feature
	dc1394_print_feature_set
	dc1394_create_handle
	dc1394_get_camera_nodes
	dc1394_get_sorted_camera_nodes
	dc1394_print_camera_info
	dc1394_setup_camera
	dc1394_release_camera
	dc1394_multi_capture
	* structures added are:
	dc1394_cameracapture 
	dc1394_feature_info
	dc1394_feature_set

Thu Feb  1 02:39:22 2000   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Updated to use new version of libraw1394
	* Changed error handling to use new libraw1394 error handling
	* Code beautification

Tue Feb  6 03:19:07 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added libraw1394 version detection to configuration process
	* Added compile options for different versions of libraw1394
	* Cleaned things up a bit

Wed Apr 11 14:24:19 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added patch from Dan Dennedy which included:
	   - resume iso receive in camera setup
	   - new dc1394_dma_unlisten() function in dc1394_capture.c
	   - mutually exclusive format enumerations
	* Made all enumerations mutually exclusive by 32 rather that 16
	* Fixed code which broke due to enumeration change
	* Added macros for feature to offset querying in dc1394_control.c
	* Added backwards compatibility to Format 7 register access code

Thu Apr 12 12:52:30 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed dc1394_get/set_video_mode/format/framerate to work with new
	  enumerations.
	* Fixed FEATURE_TO_VALUE/INQUIRY_OFFSET macros to work for both
	  FEATURE_HI and FEATURE_LO queries.
	* Exposed dc1394_feature_desc (feature description array).
	* Created dc1394_internal.h for definitions internal to the library
	* Moved some definitions from dc1394_control.h to dc1394_internal.h

Mon Apr 16 11:56:17 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed feature counting for loops in dc1394_control.c (Dan Dennedy)
	* Fixed get/set_trigger_mode functions in dc1394_control.c to work with
	  new enumerations (Damien Douxchamps)
	* Fixed color coding ID functions in dc1394_format7.c to conform to new
	  enumerations (Damien Douxchamps)

Tue Apr 24 15:12:19 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed problem with dc1394_auto_on_off() ignoring the value passed in
	  when setting auto mode on or off (fix by Li Ming
	  <ming@mpi-sb.mpg.de>)

Mon Apr 30 12:46:22 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Fixed problem with dc1394_get_camera_feature() failing due to feature
	  id being modified by feature to offset macros (fix by Li Ming)

Thu Jun  7 12:29:26 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Applied Dan Dennedy's patch which fixes image capture with newest
	  version of libraw1394 (0.9) and fixes a small spelling mistake

Tue Jul  3 16:33:50 2001   <GordPeters@smarttech.com>

	* Added functions to control the trigger feature:
	     -dc1394_set_trigger_on_off()
	     -dc1394_get_trigger_on_off()
	  (addition by Audun Jan Myrhol <audun.myrhol@q-free.com>)
